# HW1 1 Part 2

A ensemble classifier to detect smiles in 24 x 24 greyscale images. 5 classifiers in total was used and each classifier in the ensemble compares the values of 2 pixels in the image. The model was trained by using stepwise regression where the pair of pixels in a grid search that performed the best were added to the ensemble. A visualization of the chosen pixels are shown below.
